# Professional Service Business (PSB) Web Application 

### Initial Peer Review -- David Belett

## Introduction

My goal is to create a web application for a business called "Professional Service Business" (PSB).
The business business in question provides tax services (business or individual), payroll services, and accounting services to other businesses.
- i.e. Trucking company coming to PSB so all their accounting/tax/payroll is taken care of. 

Part of the web application will engage the potential customer to make an account with PSB. 
- This will be done with the use of a landing page to the PSB website.

The other part of the web application provides customers with a portal to sign up, log in, and access the professional services. The portal will educate the customers about each offer, helping them understand how the PSB expertise can support their business growth.

Guests without login credentials can view the basic information (landing page) but without access to any personalized features or detailed resources (portal).
