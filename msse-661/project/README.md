# Professional Service Business (PSB) Web Application 

### Initial Peer Review -- David Belett

## Introduction

My goal is to create a web application for a business called "Professional Service Business" (PSB).
The business business in question provides tax services (business or individual), payroll services, and accounting services to other businesses.
- i.e. Trucking company coming to PSB so all their accounting/tax/payroll is taken care of.
Part of the web application will engage the potential customer to make an account with PSB.
