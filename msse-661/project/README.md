# Professional Service Business (PSB) Web Application 

### Initial Peer Review -- David Belett

## Introduction

My goal is to create a web application for a business called "Professional Service Business" (PSB).
The business business in question provides tax services (business or individual), payroll services, and accounting services to other businesses.
- i.e. Trucking company coming to PSB so all their accounting/tax/payroll is taken care of. 

Part of the web application will engage the potential customer to make an account with PSB. 
- This will be done with the use of a landing page to the PSB website.

The other part of the web application provides customers with a portal to sign up, log in, and access the professional services. The portal will educate the customers about each offer, helping them understand how the PSB expertise can support their business growth.

Guests without login credentials can view the basic information (landing page) but without access to any personalized features or detailed resources (portal).


## User Portal

**Sign up**
- Customers can register by providing their business name, contact details, and selecting the desired services.
    - If no business name or contact details are given, then sign up should not be accepted.

**Login**
- Registered customers can securely access their accounts to manage services and view personalized content for them.
    - i.e. A business can view how important payroll management can be for them.

**Security**
- Ensures passwords and confidential data are stored and encrypted.
    - This is important since people will input their SSNs during taxes.

**Contact**
- Feature for customers to send messages/requests to staff.
    - This will be optional for this project and will depend on time.
